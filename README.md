<h3>Strategies for Collecting Data<h3>

Using the simulator on the first track I trained the car over 3 laps:
-stay in the middle of the road
-decrease speed when approaching a curve
-recover to the center when veering off the side

data are saved in a separate folder 'data' under the form of a csv and IMG folder containing screen shots of the scene
